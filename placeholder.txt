## Images to Add to Your GitHub Profile

1. **Profile Image**: You need to upload a profile photo and name it `profile.jpg` in your GitHub profile repository (zahirali/zahirali).

2. **Header GIF**: The `header.gif` can be generated from the `header.svg` using an SVG to GIF converter online, or simply keep the SVG and change the README reference to `header.svg`.

3. **Contribution Snake Animation**: The GitHub action we set up will generate this automatically once you push these changes to your repository.

4. **3D Contribution Calendar**: Upload a GIF or image named `3d-contrib.gif` showing your GitHub Skyline, or you can replace this with a link to your Skyline directly.

5. **WakaTime Stats**: To make this work, you need to:
   - Install WakaTime plugin for your IDE
   - Connect your GitHub account with WakaTime
   - Update the username in the image URL

6. **Spotify Integration**: You need to deploy a Vercel application for this feature to work. You can follow the guide at https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem to set it up.

7. **GitHub Stats Integration**: The GitHub stats widgets will work automatically with your GitHub username (zahirali).

Once you've uploaded these images to your repository, your README will be fully functional with all the animations and features!
